## Pokemon Game

As a means of improving my python, I am remaking a simplified version of the Pokemon emerald game.
While the sprites of the game were initially taken from other sources, they were heavily edited to fit the game. 
I am currently focusing on the base mechanics and will later move to implement gameplay.


Note that the game requires Pygame and SimpleGUICS2Pygame in order to run.


I am currently on haitus from this project. I will continue once my university schedule dies down a bit.
